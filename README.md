# Unsolved Issues

-Having trouble Accessing FBI Images within the show page

# User Stories
As a user I want to be able to  go to the most wanted site an and view a list top 10 most wanted criminals.  When clicking on these categories the user will be able to view the criminals picture, name and Description. and ideally the user will be able to create his/her own account where they can submit A tip form that coincides with each criminal. 

# Stretch Goals

- If I had the time I would create multiple categories other than the top 10 criminals
- I would also add a chat box and a frequently asked questions page
